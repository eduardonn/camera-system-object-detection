# Camera Surveillance System with Object Detection

The goal of this project is to detect suspicious movement in surveillance cameras using object detection in order to prevent possible invasions.

By drawing an area in the image and watching out for detections, a trigger is created, which will fire depending on the time of the day and how long the detections stayed in the area, all configurable by the user.

When a trigger fires, an alert is sent to the user through a mobile app.
